          I'm Razita Nuriyan, but please do call me Zita!! Currently, I'm a final year computer science student at the 
          University of Indonesia, having just recently came back from a semester at the Newcastle University under the IISMA
          (Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards) 2023 scheme. During my study, I've had the chance to explore a broad
          range of subjects related to computing, but my experiences focused on Web Development, Computational Statistics, and High
          Performance Computing. I'm currently doing research on a high-performance molecular dynamics simulator, as I've always 
          been passionate about science for as long as I can remember (I've represented Indonesia in an international astrophysics
          competition in high school and went on to teach astrophysics for 3 years, helping 20++ students win medals at national
          and international levels). I can probably still name the stars at the night sky if we go stargazing ðŸ”­.
